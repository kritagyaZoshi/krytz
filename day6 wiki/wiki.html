        This article is about the country. For other uses, see Nepal (disambiguation).<br>
        Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is
        mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet
        Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated
        from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse
        geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains,
        including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city.
        Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official
        language.

        The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient
        Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium
        BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were
        intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of
        Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch
        of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct
        traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The
        Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its
        Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China
        and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs,
        in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular
        republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.

        The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic
        divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were
        signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian
        Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the
        Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South
        Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and have been a significant
        contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations</p>

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl
        is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC.[which?]
        An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions
        dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the
        lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European
        and Tibeto-Burman languages.[17]</p>

    <h3 id="History">History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had
        earlier evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
        ago.[31] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same
        time</p>

    <h3 id="Geography">Geography</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with
        an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E.
        Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the
        southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west,
        and later, south and south-east.[75] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to
        subduct under the Eurasian plate.[75] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both
        created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to
        uplift the Himalayas.[75] The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke
        through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In
        the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges.[76]
        Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with
        river-borne sediment[77] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[78] Nepal lies almost completely within
        this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500
        mi)-long Himalayas,[79][80][81][82][83][84] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the
        Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[76]</p>

    <p>Energy

        Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Dam. Nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower, which it plans
        to export across South Asia.
        The bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%).[229] Most of the final
        energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the
        transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years.[229] Except for some lignite
        deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits.[229] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG
        and coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export revenue.[230] Only about 1% of the
        energy need is fulfilled by electricity.[229] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient
        of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects.
        Estimates put Nepal's economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW.[229] Nepal has
        been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW. As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the
        actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW,
        and Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the demands.[231] Major hydro-power projects
        suffer delays and setbacks.[232][233][234] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other
        countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%)
        areas.[229] The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system
        losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand.[235]

        Transportation
        Nepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes, although, within the
        country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways;[236] flights are
        frequent and support a sizeable traffic. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the
        country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. As of 2016, there
        were just over 11,890 km (7,388 mi) of paved roads, 16,100 km (10,004 mi) of unpaved roads, and just 59 km
        (37 mi) of railway line in the south.[236] As of 2018, all district headquarters (except Simikot) had been
        connected to the road network.[181] Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season; even
        national highways regularly become inoperable.[237] Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from
        countries like China, India and Japan, for building, maintenance and expansion of the road network. The only
        practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India. The national carrier, Nepal
        Airlines, is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption, and has been blacklisted by the EU.[238]
        Internally, the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets, schools, and health
        clinics a challenge.[210]

        Communication
        According to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate
        was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile; 98% of all voice telephony was
        through mobile phones.[239] Similarly, while an estimated 14.52% had access to fixed broadband, an
        additional 52.71% were accessing the internet using their mobile data subscriptions; almost 15 million of
        them with 3G or better.[239] The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two
        telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell
        (40%).[239] Of the 21% market share enjoyed by fixed broadband, around 25% was again shared by Nepal
        Telecom, with the rest going to the private Internet Service Providers.[239] Although there is high
        disparity in penetration rate between the rural and urban areas, mobile service has reached 75 districts of
        the country covering 90% of land area, and broadband access is expected to reach 90% of the population by
        2020.[236]

        Media
        Main article: Mass media in Nepal
        As of 2019, the state operates three television stations as well as national and regional radio stations.
        There are 117 private TV channels and 736 FM radio stations licensed for operation, at least 314 of them,
        community radio stations.[236] According to the 2011 census, the percentage of households possessing radio
        was 50.82%, television 36.45%, cable TV 19.33%, and computer 7.28%.[240] According to the Press Council
        Nepal classification, as of 2017 of the 833 publications producing original content, ten national dailies
        and weeklies are rated A+ class.[241] In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nepal at 106th in the world
        in terms of press freedom.[242]</p>

        Society
        Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much
        of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are
        defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or "castes". Nepal
        declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963[296] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and
        social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related
        identification has pretty much lost its importance.[citation needed]

        Family values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have
        been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority
        of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family
        elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a
        thousand marriages ending in divorce.[297] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women
        wed before reaching 18.[298]

        Many Nepali festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Dashain, Tihar, Teej, Chhath, Maghi,
        Sakela, Holi, Eid ul-Fitr, Christmas, and the Nepali new year.
